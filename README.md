An annoying problem I keep having is that when downloading images they tend to have bad file names, making them hard to search for.

Ideally, I think the browser should help us here to suggest good file names, but since it's not possible to make a plugin to do this I wanted to see if I at least could make a small tool to do it manually, learning a little bit about image classification in mean time.
